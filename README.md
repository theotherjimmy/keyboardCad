# keyboardCad

An ImplicitCad program that is the cad for the (yet unreleased) M-X Butterfly Keyboard.

# Dependencies

This program uses the ImplicitCad fork in my github theotherjimmy/ImplicitCad.
Please use that version.
My version of ImplicitCad has a small fix for mirror (negative scale) bounding boxes.

Have fun!
